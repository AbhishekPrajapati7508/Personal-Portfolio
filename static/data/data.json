        "about": "Hi! I'm Abhishek Prajapati, I'm from Ludhiana Punjab and currently I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Technology from Chandigarh Group of College, Landran. Talking about my skills I'm proficient in programming language and Full-Stack Web development. Other than these I have made several project for which I have filed patents and wrote Research papers. <br>In terms of Real world projects and experience I have built a website for our College Chandigarh Group of College to organize a confrence for authors of Research Papers. The papers were published in <span><strong>Springer</strong></span> and the conference was sponsored by <strong>All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).</strong> <br> Moreover, I have won a few inter-college coding contests and ideathons. Other than these I have presesnted my project to the head of <strong>Niti Aayog</strong> on 1<sup>st</sup> December 2021 and to the <strong>Speaker of Punjab Vidhan Sabha</strong> on the ocassion of Parivartan in 2022"

            "desc": "This method uses a deep learning model to detect drones, recognizing them outside human vision or difficult to identify. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to create a bounding box around the drone, identifying its type. The method can detect both static and mobile drones, even at high speeds. The neural network classifies images into multiple frames, identifying the drone's area and labeling. With 100% accuracy over 178 epochs, it can be used for commercial and defense purposes. The method has been trained to avoid box and object loss."

            "desc": "Cryptography is a method of hiding or protecting data from unauthorized access. With the rise of internet usage, data security is a major concern due to cyber-attacks and over-reliance on the internet. Cryptographic algorithms are used to ensure data is accessible only to the intended user. Morse code, a method of encryption, can be used to encrypt data but may pose a threat to user data. Python's Cryptography module, which uses symmetric encryption, is used to encrypt both the algorithm and data files. This paper demonstrates how Morse code, time, and Python's Cryptography module can be combined to provide maximum data safety. safety."
